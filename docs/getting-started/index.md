# Getting started

The TechZone Automation provides automation and guidance to help operations and SRE teams provision and manage complex, hybrid-cloud environments from pilot to production. This site is structured to give hands-on experience first through controlled lab exercises in the [Learn](../learn/) section. From there, the [Apply](../apply/) section provides more detailed guides to move from "Hello World" to real world. Along the way, there are a number of [Resources](../resources/) available to support and accelerate your journey.

In terms of the overall lifecycle, this guide is focused on Day 0 provisioning and Day 2 operations. The information on the [develop](https://develop.cloudnativetoolkit.dev) site covers Day 1 functions.
