# Getting Started - Overview

The Toolkit provides automation and guidance to help operations and SRE teams provision and manage complex, hybrid-cloud environments from pilot to production. This site is structured to give hands-on experience first through controlled lab exercises in the [Tutorial](../tutorials/) section. From there, the [Tasks](../tasks/) section provides more detailed guides to move from "Hello World" to real world.

In terms of the overall lifecycle, this guide is focused on Day 0 provisioning and Day 2 operations. The information on the [develop](https://develop.cloudnativetoolkit.dev){target=_blank} site covers Day 1 functions.
