## IasCable

The logic for generating automation templates in TechZone Automation Builder is provided by IasCable. IasCable has been built to convert a listing of the required capabilities of an architecture (referred to as a Bill of Materials) and generate the necessary automation to bring the architecture to life. For most use cases, TechZone Automation Builder is the recommended way to work with the automation. However, IasCable provides a more advanced level of control over the definition of the architecture.
