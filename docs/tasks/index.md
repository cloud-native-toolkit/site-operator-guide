    The tasks section should be split into 2 parts.  The *guided* tasks, using the builder (ascent) UI and the *advanced* tasks, which drop down to the iascable command line tool.

    **Guided tasks:**

    -   outline the tasks needed to be able to use a provided Bill of Materials or build and deploy a custom Bill of Materials using the builder UI (ascent)

    **Advanced tasks:**

    -   outline the tasks needed to be able to build and deploy a Bill of Materials using the iascable CLI tool
    -   outline the tasks needed to extend the toolkit by creating, testing and publishing additional modules
